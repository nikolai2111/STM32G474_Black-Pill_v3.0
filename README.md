# STM32G474 Black Pill v3.0
I'm intrigued by the compact and versatile STM32-Pills (Blue and Black) due to their ease of use for various applications. They can be seamlessly integrated into hardware prototypes, simplifying the process of testing ideas. However, I've noticed that the existing Black Pills are primarily geared toward digital tasks.

On the other hand, the STM32G474 stands out as a fascinating microcontroller, bridging the gap between the digital and analog worlds. What piques my interest are its integrated analog components like opamps and comparators, coupled with digital interfaces. This combination offers an exciting opportunity to develop systems that seamlessly blend both digital and analog functionalities.

In summary, the compact and convenient Pills are intriguing tools for rapid prototyping, but their current digital focus leaves room for exploration. In contrast, the STM32G474's integration of analog and digital components opens up exciting possibilities for creating versatile, boundary-pushing systems.
